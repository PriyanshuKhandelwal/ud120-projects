*Starter project code for students taking Udacity ud120*
This respository is cloned from udacity's github repository which stays [here]( https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git)

### Reason to clone the repository:
Earlier this code was written in Python 2.6 or 2.7 version. I will attempt to convert this code to Python version 3.5+.
